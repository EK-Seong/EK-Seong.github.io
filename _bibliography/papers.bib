  abstract= {The Bank of Korea (BoK) regularly publishes the Economic Outlook, 
  offering forecasts for key macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, inflation, 
  and unemployment rates. This study examines whether the BoK’s inflation forecasts exhibit bias, 
  specifically a tendency to align with its inflation target. We extend the Mincer and Zarnowitz (1969) 
  test to incorporate state-dependency, defining the state of the economy based on whether 
  realized inflation falls below the target at the time of the forecast. Our analysis reveals that the 
  BoK’s inflation forecasts arebiased under this state-dependent framework. Furthermore, we show 
  that applying an AR(1) bias correction strategy enhances forecast accuracy, as demonstrated by a 
  reduction in root mean square error.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
